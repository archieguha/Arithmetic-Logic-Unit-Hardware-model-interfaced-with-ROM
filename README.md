# Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-Hardware-model-interfaced-with-ROM
Hardware model of an ALU written in verilog. The ALU is fed with inputs from a predesigned ROM(also included). The ALU is controlled by an controller hardware.
The controller sends appropriate signals which allow the systematic loading of input and display of output.
